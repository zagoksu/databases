1. I installed mongodb client 

2- Data export from mysql to mongodb:

    I used these commands to create csv files from new_world database:

    select * into outfile 'city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;
    select * into outfile 'country.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from country;
    select * into outfile 'countrylanguage.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from countrylanguage;.

3. I installed mongodb server

4.Import data from csv to mongodb

    I used mongodb compass to import the data.
